      <h1>Content Plan</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Who this site is for</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to provide content creators, marketers, regulatory bodies,
and website developers specific guidance on the intent of an individual page content and templates
(i.e., Why should I choose this template, add these tags or craft this messaging for the webpage Iâ€™m about to create?),
in addition to general guidance on what elements should appear on a webpage using that
template as well as where, why, and when those elements appear on that page. </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>How this should be used</h2>
        <p>Each page in the destination site is based on a pre-existing and pre-defined sitemap, taxonomy (for tagging and SEO), messaging structure (hierarchy) and template.
          All elements and page components are approved, and follow guidelines for content development and load into the content management system (CMS): Sitecore. This ensures the integrity of the design system (e.g., interface design; component use;
design patterns; headline and subhead intent, length and re-use; content markup; etc.).</p>
        <p>All elements work together to achieve defined business and customer goals:
          <ol>
            <lh><strong>Business goals</strong></lh>
            <li>Brand comprehension</li>
            <li>Content effectiveness</li>
            <li>Lead generation</li>
            <li>Cross-category interest</li>
            <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <lh><strong>Customer goals</strong></lh>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Guidance and responsiveness</li>
            <li>Value</li>
            <li>Ease of doing business</li>
          </ol>
